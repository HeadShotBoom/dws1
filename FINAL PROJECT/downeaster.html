				<p>The Downeaster uses the <abbr title="Massachusetts Bay Transportation Association">MBTA</abbr>'s Lowell Line from Boston's North Station to Wilmington, the Wildcat Branch to Wilmington Junction, and the Haverhill Line to the Massachusetts-New Hampshire state line. From there to Portland, it uses the Pan Am Railways Freight Main Line. All of these lines were once part of the Boston and Maine Railroad; the part south of Wilmington Junction was once the mainline and a branch of the Boston and Lowell Railroad, and the rest was the mainline of the railroad.</p>
				<p>If the Downeaster were to run solely on the Haverhill Line, it would conflict with the local commuter rail service, since the Amtrak train makes no stops between Woburn and Haverhill. By using the Wildcat Branch to cross between the Lowell and Haverhill lines, the Downeaster can pass a Haverhill train.</p>

				<p>The Downeaster is separated from the rest of Amtrak’s tracks because there is no link between Boston's train stations. Downeaster passengers continuing south from Boston on Amtrak take either the <abbr title="Massachusetts Bay Transportation Association">MBTA</abbr> Orange Line to Back Bay Station or Concord Coach from Portland to South Station.</p>

			<p>At the urging of Maine's congressional delegation, Amtrak in 1990 estimated the cost of creating passenger rail service at about $50 million: $30 million for infrastructure improvements and another $20 million for equipment. The following year, Amtrak agreed to provide the equipment at no charge to the State of Maine. Earlier in that same year, the Maine State Legislature adopted its first citizen-initiated bill, the "Passenger Rail Service Act", which was endorsed by the Maine DOT and signed by the governor. In 1992, Maine voters approved a $5.4 million rail bond for right-of-way improvements, and $60,000 was granted to the Maine DOT to design a Portland intermodal terminal. Later that year, Congress approved $25.5 million for more right-of-way improvements, and 1993 saw an additional $9.5 million in track improvements. By the end of 1994, total appropriations for infrastructure had reached $38.6 million. In 1995, then-governor Angus King and Commissioner of Transportation John Melrose ordered the creation of a passenger rail authority; TrainRiders/Northeast worked with the state Chamber of Commerce and industry, Maine DOT, and others to convince the Maine Legislature to create the Northern New England Passenger Rail Authority in August.</p>
			<p>Service was initially expected to start in the 1990s. Negotiations between <abbr title="Northern New England Passenger Rail Authority">NNEPRA</abbr>, Amtrak, and Guilford Industries (now Pan Am Railways) began in 1996, but began to fail over many factors, including equipment weight and speed limits. In December 1998, a speed limit of 80 miles per hour (130 km/h) was agreed upon; the following year, the Federal Surface Transportation Board approved a limit of 79 miles per hour (127 km/h).</p>
			<p>Most right-of-way improvements were complete in 2000, but the following year, start-up was delayed again when Guilford refused to allow Amtrak to test track modulus or run trains faster than 59 miles per hour (95 km/h).</p>
			<p>After the speed issue was settled, the start date for the service was announced: December 14, 2001.</p>
			<p>In August 2007, top speeds were increased from 60 miles per hour (97 km/h) to 79 miles per hour (127 km/h), cutting 20 minutes from trips between Portland and Boston.</p>
			<p>Later, a fifth daily round trip was added to the schedule. On November 1, 2012, the route was extended north to Freeport and Brunswick.</p>
			<p>The Downeaster was the <strong>first Amtrak train to offer free Wi-Fi service</strong> and E-ticketing.</p>

			<section><!-- Start Of Ridership Section -->
			<h2 id="ridership">Ridership</h2>
			<p>Between December 2001 through 2005, annual ridership ranged from 250,000 to 300,000 passengers. Since 2005, ridership has increased an average of 13.1% per year, excluding calendar year 2009, which saw ridership shrink by 4.7%. In fiscal 2008, the Downeaster was Amtrak's fastest-growing service, with ridership up 22.9% from the previous year.</p>
			<p>In fiscal 2011, ridership topped 500,000 for the first time.</p>
			<p>Fiscal 2012 was the Downeaster's busiest year. Compared to fiscal 2011, ridership rose 6.2% to 541,757 passengers (about 1,480 passengers a day), while revenue rose 14.1% to $8.1 million.</p>
			<p>The extension to Freeport and Brunswick is expected to boost ridership by 36,000.</p>
			<p>The line's busiest station is North Station in Boston. The busiest station in Maine is the Portland Transportation Center, while Exeter is New Hampshire's busiest.</p>
			</section><!-- End Of Section -->
			<section><!-- Start Of Finances Section -->
			<h2 id="finances">Finances</h2>
			<p>In FY12 the Downeaster generated $8.1 million in revenues, $7.4 million from ticket sales. Current operational costs are around $15m annually, $5.6 million of which is covered by Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality (CMAQ) funding, $8.1 million in revenues, and $1.8 in operating subsidy from the State of Maine (less than 1/5 of 1% of the MDOT budget), Massachusetts and New Hampshire do not pay to operate the train, while their states make up 42% of overall ridership.</p>
			</section><!-- End of section -->

			<h2 id="expansion">Expansion and development</h2>
			<p>The first expansion of Downeaster service came in August 2007, when rail improvements made it possible to provide five daily round trips from Portland to Boston, up one from the original four. Future plans include operating one or two additional round trips between Portland and Boston (6 or 7 round trips daily).</p>
			<p>It is estimated that the Downeaster has an annual economic impact of $12 million from visitors to Maine, and directly or indirectly employs 200 people.</p>
			<p>A study by the Chicago-based Center for Neighborhood Technology suggested that the extension, combined with commercial developments along the <q>Downeaster Corridor</q>, could generate several billion dollars in construction investments plus $55 million annually in tax revenue for the state of Maine.</p>
			<h3>Brunswick</h3>
			<p>The initial goal of <abbr title="Northern New England Passenger Rail Authority">NNEPRA</abbr> was to expand service to Brunswick within five years of the 2001 launch of the Downeaster, but funding – among other obstacles – hampered that plan. Although ground was broken for the Brunswick station on October 2008 – a retail development that included shops, condominiums, an inn and office space – it wasn't until January 2010 that the Northern New England Passenger Rail Authority received a $35 million grant to fund the expansion from Portland. This grant from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 funded track and signal upgrades for the Portland-Brunswick line, and Pan Am Railways began work on the line in summer 2010. Officials announced the completion of the platforms in Brunswick and Freeport on May 14, 2012, and service began on November 1, 2012.</p>
			<p>A layover facility is planned in Brunswick which will be able to store three trainsets inside; Downeaster trains are currently stored outdoors in Portland. The new facility would also allow for a third daily Brunswick to Boston trip (currently there are only two trips to Boston from Brunswick). The projected is expected to break ground during Summer 2013, and be completed by the end of 2014.</p>
			<h3>Lewiston-Auburn</h3>
			<p>In April 2013, <abbr title="Northern New England Passenger Rail Authority">NNEPRA</abbr> announced that a plan to expand passenger rail service to Lewiston-Auburn, Maine's second-largest metropolitan area, would be released later in the year.</p>
			<h3>High-speed rail</h3>
			<p>The route the Downeaster follows is designated by the Federal Railroad Administration as a potential high-speed rail corridor. If the Northern New England Corridor were funded and completed as proposed, passenger trains would travel at up to 110 miles per hour (177 km/h) between Boston, Portland, and Lewiston.</p>
			<p>In 2009 the rail authority applied for federal stimulus money to increase train speeds - cutting 10 to 12 minutes off the current travel time - and increase the number of daily round trips from five to seven. No money was ever awarded for this project.</p>
