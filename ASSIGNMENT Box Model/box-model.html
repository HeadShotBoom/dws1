			<p>Digital single-lens reflex cameras (also called digital SLR or DSLR) are digital cameras combining the optics and the mechanisms of a single-lens reflex camera with a digital imaging sensor, as opposed to photographic film. The reflex design scheme is the primary difference between a DSLR and other digital cameras. In the reflex design, light travels through the lens, then to a mirror that alternates to send the image to either the viewfinder or the image sensor. The alternative would be to have a viewfinder with its own lens, hence the term "single lens" for this design. By using only one lens, the viewfinder presents an image that will not perceptibly differ from what is captured by the camera's sensor.</p>
		<h2 id="design">The design of DSLR cameras</h2>
			<p>Like SLRs DSLRs typically use interchangeable lenses.</p>
			<p>They typically consist of the following standard parts</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Camera Lens</li>
				<li>Reflex mirror</li>
				<li>Focal-plane shutter</li>
				<li>Image Sensor</li>
				<li>Matte focusing screen</li>
				<li>Condenser lens</li>
				<li>Pentaprism/pentamirror</li>
				<li>Viewfinder eyepiece</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Focusing can be manual or automatic, activated by pressing half-way on the shutter release or a dedicated AF button. To take an image, the mirror swings upwards in the direction of the arrow, the focal-plane shutter (3) opens, and the image is projected and captured on the image sensor (4), after which actions, the shutter closes, the mirror returns to the 45-degree angle, and the built in drive mechanism re-tensions the shutter for the next exposure.</p>
			<p>Compared to the newer concept of mirrorless interchangeable-lens cameras this mirror/prism system is the characteristic difference providing direct, accurate optical preview with separate autofocus and exposure metering sensors. Essential parts of all digital cameras are some electronics like amplifier, analog to digital converter, image processor and other (micro-)processors for processing the digital image, performing data storage and/or driving an electronic display.</p>
		<h3 id="phase">Phase-detection autofocus</h3>
			<p>DSLRs typically use a phase-detection autofocus system. This method of focus is very fast, and results in less focus "searching", but requires the incorporation of a special sensor into the optical path, so it is usually only used in SLR designs. Digicams that use the main sensor to create a live preview on the LCD or electronic viewfinder must use contrast-detect autofocus instead, which is slower in some implementations.</p>
		
		<h2 id="common">Features commonly seen in DSLR designs</h2>
		<h3 id="mode">Mode dial</h3>
			<p>Digital SLR cameras, along with most other digital cameras, generally have a mode dial to access standard camera settings or automatic scene-mode settings. Sometimes called a "PASM" dial, they typically provide as minimum Program, Aperture-priority, Shutter-priority, and full Manual modes. Scene modes vary and are inherently less customizable. They often include full-auto, landscape, portrait, action, macro, and night modes, among others. Professional DSLRs seldom contain automatic scene modes because professionals understand their equipment and can quickly adjust the settings to take the image that they want.</p>
		<h3 id="dust">Dust reduction systems</h3>
			<p>A method to prevent dust entering the chamber, by using a "dust cover" filter right behind the lens mount, was used by Sigma in its first DSLR, the Sigma SD9, in 2002.</p>
			<p>Olympus used a built-in sensor cleaning mechanism in its first DSLR that had a sensor exposed to air, the Olympus E-1, in 2003.</p>
		<h3 id="lenses">Interchangeable lenses</h2>
			<p>The ability to exchange lenses, to select the best lens for the current photographic need, and to allow the attachment of specialized lenses, is one of the key factors in the popularity of DSLR cameras, although this feature is not unique to the DSLR design and mirrorless interchangeable lens cameras are becoming increasingly popular. Interchangeable lenses for SLRs and DSLRs (also known as "Glass") are built to operate correctly with a specific lens mount that is generally unique to each brand. A photographer will often use lenses made by the same manufacturer as the camera body (for example, Canon EF lenses on a Canon body) although there are also many independent lens manufacturers, such as Sigma, Tamron, Tokina, and Vivitar that make lenses for a variety of different lens mounts. There are also lens adapters that allow a lens for one lens mount to be used on a camera body with a different lens mount but with often reduced functionality.</p>
			<p>Many lenses are mountable, "diaphragm-and-meter-compatible", on modern DSLRs and on older film SLRs that use the same lens mount. However, when lenses designed for 35 mm film or equivalently sized digital image sensors are used on DSLRs with smaller sized sensors, the image is effectively cropped and the lens appears to have a longer focal length than its stated focal length. Most DSLR manufacturers have introduced lines of lenses with image circles optimized for the smaller sensors and focal lengths equivalent to those generally offered for existing 35 mm mount DSLRs, mostly in the wide angle range. These lenses tend not to be completely compatible with full frame sensors or 35 mm film because of the smaller imaging circle[1] and, with some Canon EF-S lenses, interfere with the reflex mirrors on full-frame bodies.</p>
		<h3 id=hd">HD video capture</h3>
			<p>Since 2008, manufacturers have offered DSLRs capable of recording high-definition video.</p>
			<p>In capturing HD video, HDSLRs use in general the full imager area, though not all pixels, causing video artifacts to some extent. Compared to the much smaller image sensors found in the typical camcorder, the HDSLR's much larger sensor yields distinctly different image characteristics.[2] HDSLRs can achieve much shallower depth of field and superior low-light performance. However, the low proportion of active pixels is more susceptible to aliasing artifacts (such as moiré patterns) and the CMOS rolling shutter tends to be more noticeable. Furthermore, due to the DSLR's optical construction, HDSLRs typically lack one or more video functions found on other camcorders, such as autofocus while shooting; powered zoom; and an electronic viewfinder. These and other handling limitations prevent the HDSLR from being operated as a simple point-and-shoot camcorder, instead demanding some level of planning and skill for shooting.</p>
			<p>Video functionality has continued to improve since the introduction of the HDSLR. Among the improvements include higher-resolution video (such as 1080p24); improved autofocus and manual exposure control; support for formats compatible with high-definition television broadcast; Blu-ray disc mastering</p>
		<h2 id="history">History</h2>
		<p>In 1969 Willard S. Boyle and George E. Smith invented the first successful imaging technology using a digital sensor, a CCD (Charge-Coupled Device). CCD would allow the rapid development of digital photography. For their contribution to digital photography Boyle and Smith were awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2009.</p>
		<p>In 1975 Kodak engineer Steven Sasson invented the first digital still camera, which used a Fairchild 100×100 pixel CCD.</p>
		<p>On August 25, 1981 Sony unveiled a prototype of the Sony Mavica. This camera was an analog electronic camera that featured interchangeable lenses and a SLR viewfinder.</p>
		<p>In 1995, Nikon co-developed the Nikon E series with Fujifilm. The E series included the Nikon E2/E2S, Nikon E2N/E2NS and the Nikon E3/E3S, with the E3S released in December 1999.</p>
		<p>In 1999, Nikon announced the Nikon D1. The D1's body was similar to Nikon's professional 35 mm film SLRs, and it had the same Nikkor lens mount, allowing the D1 to use Nikon's existing line of AI/AIS manual-focus and AF lenses. Although Nikon and other manufacturers had produced digital SLR cameras for several years prior, the D1 was the first professional digital SLR that displaced Kodak's then-undisputed reign over the professional market.</p>
		<p>Over the next decade, other camera manufacturers entered the DSLR market, including Canon, Kodak, Fujifilm, Minolta (later Konica Minolta, and ultimately acquired by Sony), Pentax (whose camera division is now owned by Ricoh), Olympus, Panasonic, Samsung, Sigma, and Sony.</p>
		<p>n January 2000, Fujifilm announced the FinePix S1 Pro, the first consumer-level DSLR.</p>
